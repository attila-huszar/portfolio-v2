  "intro": "**Greetings! I'm Attila**, enthusiastic **front-end developer** specialized in crafting engaging and performant websites & apps, primarily with **React** (Next.js).",
  "about": "After graduating with a degree in socio-economics and living a few years abroad, I made the decision to follow my passion for programming and enrolled in a coding bootcamp, where I gained expertise in full-stack web development. My main stack includes **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js**. Additionally, I'm also familiar with Node.js, Express, and MySQL.<br /><br />What I find most enjoyable about programming is the problem-solving aspect; there's a sense of satisfaction when I figure out a solution to a challenging problem. It's such a rewarding journey to keep learning and exploring new technologies.<br /><br />When I'm not coding, I like playing video and board games, or taking trips, whether it's cycling in nature or venturing further to explore new places.",
