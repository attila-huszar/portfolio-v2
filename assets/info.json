  "intro": "Greetings! I'm **Attila**, an enthusiastic **frontend-focused fullstack developer**, specialized in building performant, intuitive, and visually polished websites and apps â€” primarily with **React** and **Node.js**.",
  "about": "After graduating with a degree in socio-economics and living some years abroad, I made the decision to follow my passion for programming and started working as a frontend developer at NIX Tech Budapest. My main stack became **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **React**. Additionally, I've gained knowledge with **Node.js**, **Express**, **SQL**, and **Docker**.<br /><br />What I find most enjoyable about programming is the problem-solving aspect; there's a sense of satisfaction when I figure out a solution to a challenging problem. It's such a rewarding journey to keep learning and exploring new technologies.<br /><br />When I'm not coding, I like playing video and board games, or taking trips, whether it's cycling in nature or venturing further to explore new places.",
